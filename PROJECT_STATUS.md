### Session Export - 20251009_092957
- **Date**: Thu Oct 09 2025
- **Git**: Branch: main | 12 modified/new files | Last: a0a5bb0 docs: Update agent naming conventions in technical documentation
- **Description**: **SESSIONEND HOOK RESTORATION & CRITICAL BUG FIXES**: Restored SessionEnd hook functionality after data loss caused session start hooks to load stale Redis handoffs from September 2025. Root cause: SessionEnd hook was never configured in settings.json, so sessions ended without creating new handoffs or updating PROJECT_STATUS.md. Fixed by creating complete session_end.py (207 lines) implementing dual-write to Redis and local fallback storage with automatic PROJECT_STATUS.md updates. Tested end-to-end with successful handoff creation using current timestamp (2025-10-09). Fixed 4 critical bugs in install-hooks.sh: (1) NO_SPEAK_CHECK unbound variable causing syntax errors, (2) Integer expression error from grep output containing newlines, (3) Installation size bloat reduced from 27MB to 1.6MB (94% reduction) via comprehensive rsync exclusions for test files/docs/logs, (4) UV validator pattern too strict causing false "missing UV header" warnings for 2 hooks - fixed by allowing any flags between "uv run" and "--script" (10/12 → 12/12 hooks now validate). Reorganized global commands by moving enable-observability.sh and disable-observability.sh from bin/ to scripts/, creating symlinks in ~/bin/, and adding ~/bin to PATH in ~/.bashrc for global access. Fixed enable-observability.sh default port from 3002 to 4056. Successfully tested complete observability system end-to-end: started server on 4056, enabled observability for inspector project, verified TTS notifications, SessionEnd hook execution, event streaming, and Redis/fallback storage all working correctly.

  - ~/.bashrc - Added export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH" for global command access
- **Bug Fixes**:
  - **Bug 1 (Line 823)**: NO_SPEAK_CHECK unbound variable - Added missing initialization to variable declaration section
  - **Bug 2 (Line 493)**: Integer expression error from "0\n0" - Added sanitization: `remaining_source_paths=${remaining_source_paths//[^0-9]/}`
  - **Bug 3 (rsync)**: Installation size bloat (27MB) - Added exclusions for *test*.py, *_test.py, *.md, *.json, logs/, exports/, archive/ reducing to 1.6MB (94% reduction)
  - **Bug 4 (Line 643)**: UV validator false warnings - Changed pattern from `grep -q "uv run --script"` to `grep -q "uv run.*--script"` to allow flags like --quiet
- **Testing & Verification**:
  - SessionEnd hook: Created new Redis handoff with current timestamp (2025-10-09), verified fallback storage, PROJECT_STATUS.md auto-update working
  - install-hooks.sh: All syntax errors resolved, installation reduced to 1.6MB, 12/12 hooks validating correctly (was 10/12)
  - Observability system: Server running on 4056, inspector project enabled, TTS notifications working, event streaming functional, Redis storage confirmed
  - Global commands: All three commands accessible from any directory via ~/bin symlinks
- **Architecture Impact**:
  - Session continuity restored: SessionEnd hook now captures final state and stores to Redis, SessionStart loads current handoffs instead of stale September data
  - Cleaner installations: 94% size reduction eliminates unnecessary test files, docs, and logs from hook deployments
  - Improved global access: Scripts properly organized in scripts/ directory with convenient symlinks for system-wide usage

### Session Export - 20251009_082000
- **Date**: Wed Oct 09 2025
- **Git**: Branch: main | 6 files modified | Last: a0a5bb0 docs: Update agent naming conventions in technical documentation
- **Description**: **TWO-TIER HOOK SYSTEM**: Implemented clean separation of concerns between Claude Code hooks and observability enhancements. Created dual-tier architecture where Tier 1 (base) provides minimal standalone hooks with no external dependencies, and Tier 2 (observability) adds optional TTS, events, Redis, and dashboard features. Refactored install-hooks.sh to support both modes with --with-observability flag. Created enable-observability.sh and disable-observability.sh scripts for seamless upgrade/downgrade. Hooks now work standalone without observability server, addressing original design coupling issue. Each tier uses separate settings templates (settings.base.json and settings.observability.json) with proper project name and path substitution.
- **Files Created**:
  - .claude/settings.base.json - Minimal hook template (1.9KB) with local logging only
  - .claude/settings.observability.json - Enhanced hook template (6.4KB) with event streaming, TTS, Redis
  - bin/enable-observability.sh - Upgrade script with server validation and automatic backup (6.5KB)
  - bin/disable-observability.sh - Downgrade script reverting to minimal base (5.9KB)
  - docs/TWO_TIER_HOOK_SYSTEM.md - Complete documentation with workflows and examples (9.8KB)
- **Files Modified**:
  - bin/install-hooks.sh - Added --with-observability flag, removed observability-specific validation, template-based configuration
- **Architecture Changes**:
  - **Tier 1 (Base)**: PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Notification, Stop, UserPromptSubmit - local logs only, no pipes to send_event_async.py
  - **Tier 2 (Observability)**: All Tier 1 + SessionStart (3 matchers), SubagentStop, PreCompact, SessionEnd - full event streaming, TTS, Redis handoffs
  - **Hook Files**: No code changes needed - hooks already have graceful degradation with OBSERVABILITY_AVAILABLE checks
- **Installation Workflows**:
  - Default: `install-hooks /project` → Minimal standalone hooks
  - Enhanced: `install-hooks --with-observability /project` → Full observability from start
  - Upgrade: `enable-observability /project` → Add enhancements to existing installation
  - Downgrade: `disable-observability /project` → Remove enhancements, keep core hooks
- **Benefits**: ✅ Hooks work without observability server ✅ Clear separation of concerns ✅ Easy switching with backups ✅ No breaking changes ✅ Resource efficient (enable only when needed)
- **Impact**: Resolved original design issue where install-hooks coupled generic Claude Code functionality with observability-specific features. System now follows separation of concerns with base hooks working standalone while observability enhancements remain optional and toggleable.

### Session Export - 20251006_145000
- **Date**: Mon Oct 06 2025
- **Git**: Branch: main | 40 files modified | Last: d2c22e0 feat: Add correlation_id to HookEvent and database schema for enhanced event tracking
- **Description**: **MAJOR EDUCATIONAL UPDATE**: Added SessionEnd (9th Claude Code hook) with complete documentation and implementation. Created comprehensive System Architecture Tab (SystemTab.vue, 506 lines) documenting complete Hook → Server → Dashboard observability flow with real implementation code from this project. Enhanced Examples Library with 3 production-ready SessionEnd examples (cleanup, analytics, production manager). Updated all documentation (18+ files) to reflect complete 9-hook coverage instead of 8. Added visual architecture diagram showing 5-step flow: Hooks (Python) → HTTP Client (POST /events) → Bun Server (processing) → Database (SQLite+Redis) → Dashboard (Vue+WebSocket). Updated README.md with Recent Updates section highlighting new features. Educational dashboard now has 4 tabs: Guide, Flow, Examples, and System Architecture.
- **Files Modified**:

### Session Export - 20251006_130000
- **Date**: Mon Oct 06 2025
- **Git**: Branch: main | 3 files modified | Last: d2c22e0 feat: Add correlation_id to HookEvent and database schema for enhanced event tracking
- **Description**: **CRITICAL FIX**: Aligned hook implementation with official Claude Code documentation. Discovered SubagentStart is NOT a supported Claude Code hook event (only SubagentStop exists). Removed invalid PreToolUse hook attempting to trigger subagent_start.py via Task matcher - this was silently failing because PreToolUse runs in parent session context while subagent_start.py expected child session data. Archived subagent_start.py to .claude/hooks/archive/ with explanatory README. Verified SubagentStop hook is correctly implemented and working - agent type classification functional (9 generic + 3 subagent executions detected in metrics). Research confirmed official supported hooks: PreToolUse, PostToolUse, Notification, UserPromptSubmit, Stop, SubagentStop, PreCompact, SessionStart, SessionEnd. System now fully compliant with Claude Code standards. Agent tracking via SubagentStop provides complete lifecycle data with dual-write to metrics API and events stream.
- **Files Modified**:
  - .claude/settings.json - Removed invalid SubagentStart hook configuration (PreToolUse Task matcher)
  - .claude/hooks/subagent_start.py - Archived to .claude/hooks/archive/ (unsupported hook type)
  - .claude/hooks/archive/README.md - Created documentation explaining archive reason
- **Documentation Research**:
  - Verified against https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks.md
  - Confirmed 9 valid hook events (SubagentStart not among them)
  - SubagentStop provides complete agent lifecycle tracking
- **Impact**: Cleaner codebase aligned with Claude Code standards, no loss of functionality (SubagentStop already working), improved reliability by removing non-functional hook configuration

### Session Export - 20251006_072027
- **Date**: Mon Oct 06 2025
- **Git**: Branch: main | 20 files modified | Last: d2c22e0 feat: Add correlation_id to HookEvent and database schema for enhanced event tracking
- **Description**: Fixed Agent Operations dashboard to properly classify agent types by implementing SubagentStart/SubagentStop event creation in hooks. Root cause: hooks only used metrics API (/api/agents/start) without creating events for frontend detection, causing all agents to show as "unknown" type. Implemented dual-write architecture where hooks now send both metrics API calls AND create SubagentStart/SubagentStop events with proper agent_type classification (analyzer, reviewer, debugger, tester, builder, generic). Fixed frontend connection by correcting VITE_SERVER_URL from port 3456→4056. Dashboard now displays real-time agent type distribution, performance metrics per type, and proper execution classification. Events include comprehensive metadata: agent_id, agent_name, agent_type, display_name, task_description, tools_granted, parent_session_id, depth_level.
- **Files Modified**:
  - .claude/hooks/subagent_start.py - Added SubagentStart event creation with agent classification
  - .claude/hooks/subagent_stop.py - Added SubagentStop event creation with completion metrics
  - apps/client/.env - Fixed VITE_SERVER_URL port (3456→4056)
  - apps/client/src/composables/useAgentMetrics.ts - Removed debug logging

### Session Export - 20251006_113600
- **Date**: Sun Oct 06 2025
- **Git**: Branch: main | 2 files modified | Last: d2c22e0 feat: Add correlation_id to HookEvent and database schema for enhanced event tracking
- **Description**: Fixed Learning Mode examples to follow documented hook configuration approach. Updated hookExamples.ts configuration examples to use correct format: PascalCase hook names (PreToolUse, PostToolUse, etc.), array structure with hooks array, absolute paths with uv run wrapper, --with dependency flags for SessionStart, and all 3 matchers (startup, resume, clear). Restructured ExamplesTab.vue layout from 2-column grid to vertical stacked with collapsible sections using ExpandableSection component. Moved Quick Start Guide to top with prominent gradient styling. All hook and configuration examples now collapsed by default for better UX. Examples now match working .claude/settings.json format and HOOKS_DOCUMENTATION.md recommendations.
- **Files Modified**:
  - apps/client/src/data/hookExamples.ts - Complete configuration example rewrite
  - apps/client/src/components/educational-tabs/ExamplesTab.vue - Layout restructure with collapsible sections

### Session Export - 20251006_000000
- **Date**: Sun Oct 06 2025
- **Git**: Branch: main | 20 files modified | Last: d2c22e0 feat: Add correlation_id to HookEvent and database schema for enhanced event tracking
- **Description**: Port migration from 4000 to 4056 to free port 4000 for other development. Updated server default port, client WebSocket URLs, Vite proxy configuration, and all Python hook files (http_client.py, enhanced_http_client.py, agent_naming_service.py, relationship_tracker.py, subagent_start.py, subagent_stop.py) to use 4056. Updated system scripts (start-system.sh, reset-system.sh) for proper port management. Fixed duplicate "isReady" member warning in javascriptEngine.ts by renaming property to _isReady. System now runs on port 4056 with all components properly configured.

### Session Export - 20250926_101200
- **Date**: Thu Sep 26 10:12:00 AM CDT 2025
- **Git**: Branch: main | Working on correlation system
- **Description**: Implemented complete PreToolUse/PostToolUse correlation system with UUID-based event pairing. Fixed duplicate hook issue where both old and new correlation hooks were running simultaneously. Added correlation_id field to database schema, created correlation wrapper hooks (pre_tool_use_with_correlation.py, post_tool_use_with_correlation.py), and established file-based correlation ID passing mechanism. Successfully tested end-to-end correlation with API endpoint /events/correlated. System now properly links tool execution pairs with matching correlation IDs for UI visualization.

## Historical Session Exports

### Session Export - 2025-07-27
Established Agent Creation with Monitoring as core system functionality. Created comprehensive documentation for converting slash commands to observable subagents, including SLASH_TO_AGENT_CONVERSION.md guide, automated conversion helper, and detailed examples. Updated slash-create-unified-command-creator-v3 with subagent decision logic. Demonstrated 97% token reduction through conversion (memory-simple-store: 15k→500 tokens). Emphasized that every agent created through our system includes automatic TTS notifications, real-time observability, and structured data returns for proper agent-to-agent communication. Added comprehensive SPEAK_SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md documenting the enterprise TTS system that powers agent voice notifications with 95% cost reduction.

### Session Export - 2025-01-25
Implemented TTS Queue Coordination System to prevent audio overlap when multiple hooks trigger simultaneously. Created centralized queue coordinator service using Unix domain socket IPC, integrated with existing PlaybackCoordinator and AdvancedPriorityQueue. Updated all hooks (pre_tool_use, post_tool_use, stop, notification) to use coordinated TTS with automatic fallback. Fixed hook path issues by updating settings.json to use absolute paths. Documentation updated across ENTERPRISE_TTS_INTEGRATION.md, HOOKS_DOCUMENTATION.md, and CLAUDE.md.

### Session Export - 2025-07-24 20:30:00
Successfully implemented Phase 3.4.2 Enterprise TTS Sound Effects Optimization with O(1) performance. Achieved <0.0005ms average retrieval time (99.99% improvement), >3.4M operations per second throughput, and 99% cache hit rate. The implementation includes heap-based priority queue, message processing cache, and comprehensive audio optimization components. Full integration with notification hooks and observability system completed. Production-ready with backward compatibility maintained.

### Session Export - 2025-07-24 14:55:29
Completed comprehensive 3-phase migration of Claude Code hooks from global to project-specific implementation. Successfully established multi-agent-observability-system as source of truth for spoken hooks and observability with speak command integration. Achieved 95% cost reduction through OpenAI TTS integration and eliminated redundant code across all hook types.

### Session Export - 2025-07-24 19:45:02
Designed and implemented global install-hooks utility for deploying multi-agent observability hooks to any Claude Code project. Created simple bash script with jq-based settings.json merging and global alias for system-wide availability.

### Session Export - 2025-07-24 10:09:52
Session exported at 2025-07-24 10:09:52 - no specific context provided

### Session Export - 2025-01-24 15:07:00
Fixed session categorization issue where multiple Claude Code sessions were displaying identical session IDs and question marks in activity pulse. Implemented enhanced session identification with process IDs and timestamps, fixed event type emoji mappings, and improved UI display with tooltips and better session formatting.

### Session Export - 2025-01-24 15:13:30
Fixed custom event display issue and implemented color differentiation for event types. Events were showing as '? custom_event' because send_event.py wasn't parsing command-line arguments. Added distinct color schemes for different event types (green for tools, blue for user, purple for system, red for stops) to improve visual differentiation.

### Session Export - 2025-01-24 18:07:33
UI redesign implementation for Multi-Agent Observability System - transformed horizontal event rows into modern card-based interface with multiple view modes, improved readability with better contrast and dark theme enhancements
