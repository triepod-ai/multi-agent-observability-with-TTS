## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Basic Code Execution
```typescript
import { wasiRuntimeManager } from './services/wasiRuntimeManager';

const result = await wasiRuntimeManager.executeCode({
  language: 'python',
  code: 'print("Hello, World!")',
  inputs: [],
  limits: { maxMemoryMB: 16, maxExecutionTimeMs: 5000 }
});

console.log(result.output); // "Hello, World!"
console.log(result.metrics); // { executionTimeMs: 45, memoryUsedMB: 2.1, ... }
```

### Assessment Question with Code Execution
```typescript
{
  id: 'python-function-exercise',
  type: 'code-execution',
  language: 'python',
  starterCode: 'def calculate_area(length, width):\n    # Your code here\n    pass',
  expectedOutput: 'Area: 15',
  // Automatic scoring based on output match
}
```

### Resource Monitoring
```typescript
import { resourceMonitor } from './services/resourceMonitor';

resourceMonitor.subscribe((usage) => {
  console.log(`Memory: ${usage.memoryMB}MB`);
  console.log(`Time: ${usage.executionTimeMs}ms`);
});
```
