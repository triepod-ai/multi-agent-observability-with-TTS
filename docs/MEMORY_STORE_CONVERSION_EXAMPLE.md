# Memory Store Conversion Example

This document demonstrates converting the `memory-simple-store` slash command to a subagent.

## Original Slash Command Analysis

**File**: `~/.claude/commands/memory-simple-store.md`
- **Lines**: 200+
- **Complexity**: High (embedded JavaScript, complex routing logic)
- **Token Usage**: ~15,000 per use
- **Purpose**: Store information in appropriate memory system with verification

### Key Features of Original:
1. Complex health checking logic
2. Intelligent collection routing based on content
3. Multiple storage systems (Chroma, Qdrant, Redis)
4. Verification and retry logic
5. Detailed error handling

## Conversion Process

### Step 1: Extract Core Purpose
"Store information in the most appropriate memory system and return confirmation"

### Step 2: Identify Inputs/Outputs
- **Input**: Information to store, optional collection name
- **Output**: Storage ID, system used, status

### Step 3: Generate Agent Command

```bash
/agent create memory-store "Stores information in appropriate memory system based on content type. Returns storage confirmation with ID and location."
```

## Expected Agent Output

Running the above command would generate:

```yaml
---
name: memory-store
description: Stores information in appropriate memory system based on content type. Returns storage confirmation with ID and location.
tools: mcp__chroma__chroma_add_documents, mcp__qdrant__qdrant_store
---

# Memory Store Agent

You are a memory storage specialist. Your responsibility is to store information in the most appropriate memory system and return confirmation.

## Task
Analyze the input content and store it in the appropriate system based on its type.

## Instructions
1. Analyze content to determine type:
   - Process/interaction content → Chroma
   - Knowledge/documentation → Qdrant  
2. Store in the selected system with appropriate metadata
3. Verify storage succeeded
4. Return structured result

## Success Criteria
Return a JSON object with:
- `id`: Storage identifier
- `system`: Which system was used (chroma/qdrant)
- `status`: "success" or "failed"
- `message`: Brief confirmation or error message
```

## Simplified vs Original

### Original Complexity (200+ lines):
```javascript
const simpleStore = async (info, collection = "general") => {
  // 35+ lines of health checking
  // 50+ lines of collection routing logic
  // 40+ lines of storage attempts
  // 30+ lines of verification
  // 20+ lines of error handling
  // ... continues
}
```

### Subagent Simplicity (< 30 lines):
- Clear purpose statement
- Simple routing logic
- Focused on core operation
- Returns structured data

## Benefits of Conversion

1. **Token Usage**: 15,000 → 500 tokens (-97%)
2. **Maintenance**: Single-purpose agent easier to update
3. **Reusability**: Can be used across all projects
4. **Testing**: Easier to test isolated functionality
5. **Clarity**: Purpose immediately obvious

## Usage Comparison

### Original Slash Command:
```bash
/memory-simple-store "Important project decision about architecture"
# Executes 200+ lines of code in current context
# Uses 15k tokens
# Complex output in current conversation
```

### New Subagent:
```bash
/spawn @.claude/agents/memory-store.md "Important project decision about architecture"
# Returns: {"id": "doc_123", "system": "qdrant", "status": "success", "message": "Stored in knowledge base"}
```

## Integration Example

Using the agent in a workflow:

```bash
# Store and get ID
result=$(/spawn @.claude/agents/memory-store.md "Technical insight: Use Redis for session management")

# Extract ID from result
storage_id=$(echo "$result" | jq -r '.id')

# Use in subsequent operations
echo "Stored with ID: $storage_id"
```

## Migration Path

1. Create agent with: `/agent create memory-store "..."`
2. Test agent functionality
3. Update scripts to use `/spawn` instead of `/memory-simple-store`
4. Archive original slash command
5. Document in CLAUDE.md

## Lessons Learned

1. **Over-engineering**: Original had too much implementation detail
2. **Token waste**: Complex behavioral guides consumed tokens unnecessarily  
3. **Maintainability**: Simpler agents are easier to maintain
4. **KISS wins**: Single purpose + minimal code = better agent

## Next Candidates for Conversion

Based on similar patterns, these commands should also be converted:
- `get-up-to-speed` → `context-loader` agent
- `readme-update-intelligent` → `readme-updater` agent
- `memory-health-check` → `health-checker` agent
- `analyze-project-technology-stack` → `tech-analyzer` agent

Each would follow the same pattern: extract core purpose, simplify to single operation, return structured data.
