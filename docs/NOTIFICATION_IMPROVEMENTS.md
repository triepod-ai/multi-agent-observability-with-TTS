# Notification System Improvements

This document describes the improvements made to the Multi-Agent Observability System's notification system to address timeout errors and enhance stop event summaries.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. False Positive Timeout Error Notifications (v1.2.0)
**Problem**: Users were hearing "Bryan error operation timed out" for normal operations that weren't actually timing out.

**Root Cause**: The `post_tool_use.py` hook was checking if the word "timeout" appeared anywhere in the entire tool response, causing false positives when file contents or other data contained that word.

**Solution**: Refined the timeout detection logic to:
- Only check for "timeout" in actual error messages, not entire response
- Add special handling for "unknown" tools to prevent spurious errors
- Prioritize timeout detection to ensure proper error categorization

### 2. HTTP Request Timeout Errors
**Problem**: Users were receiving "operation timed out" errors when hooks took longer than Claude Code's internal timeout to execute.

**Root Cause**: The `send_event.py` script was making synchronous HTTP requests to the observability server, which could take several seconds, especially when the server was slow or under load.

**Solution**: Created an async wrapper (`send_event_async.py`) that:
- Spawns the original `send_event.py` in a background process
- Exits immediately to prevent Claude Code timeout
- Maintains all original functionality without blocking

### 3. Stop Hook Summary Issues
**Problem**: The stop hook was generating grammatically incorrect summaries like "Bryan, I have finished completed the task"

**Root Causes**:
1. Generic fallback was "completing the requested task" 
2. Summary generation was too generic and not contextual
3. File path tracking didn't preserve directory information for hooks

**Solutions**:
1. Fixed grammar in fallback to "completing your request"
2. Enhanced summary generation with:
   - More concise, natural language summaries
   - Context-aware detection based on file types and tools used
   - Proper hook file detection with directory preservation
   - Shortened summaries to avoid redundancy

## Implementation Details

### False Positive Timeout Fix

**File**: `.claude/hooks/post_tool_use.py`

**Changes**:
1. **Refined timeout detection**: Only checks for "timeout" in error message fields
```python
# Check for timeout indicators in error messages first
error_msg = tool_response.get('error', '')
if error_msg and ('timeout' in error_msg.lower() or 'timed out' in error_msg.lower()):
    error_info = {
        'type': 'timeout_error',
        'message': 'Operation timed out',
        'details': tool_response
    }
```

2. **Unknown tool handling**: Skip error detection unless explicit error present
```python
# Skip error detection for unknown tools unless there's an explicit error
if tool == 'unknown' and isinstance(tool_response, dict):
    if not (tool_response.get('is_error') or tool_response.get('error')):
        return None
```

**Testing**: Created comprehensive test suite in `.claude/hooks/test_timeout_fix.py` to verify:
- Real timeout errors are still detected
- False positives from content are eliminated
- Unknown tools handled gracefully

**Verification**: Tested in production (2025-01-25) confirming:
- ✅ Reading files containing "timeout" no longer triggers false errors
- ✅ Editing files with timeout-related content works without false alerts
- ✅ TodoWrite operations with "timeout" in descriptions don't cause errors
- ✅ All test cases pass successfully

### Async Event Sending

**File**: `.claude/hooks/send_event_async.py`
```python
#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script
# Spawns send_event.py in background and exits immediately
subprocess.Popen(cmd, stdin=subprocess.PIPE, stdout=subprocess.DEVNULL, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL, text=True).communicate(stdin_data)
sys.exit(0)
```

**Configuration**: Updated `.claude/settings.json` to use async wrapper for:
- PreToolUse events
- PostToolUse events  
- Notification events
- UserPromptSubmit events

### Enhanced Summary Generation

**File**: `.claude/hooks/stop.py`

**Improvements**:
1. **File Path Tracking**: Preserves "hooks/" directory info for better detection
2. **Natural Language**: Shorter, more conversational summaries
3. **Context Detection**: Analyzes last prompt for better context
4. **Specific Summaries**: 
   - "building 3 UI components" instead of "implementing UI redesign with 3 new components"
   - "updating documentation" instead of "updating the documentation"
   - "fixing issues" when error/fix keywords detected
   - "updating hooks" when hook files modified

### Testing

**File**: `.claude/hooks/test_stop_hook.py`

Comprehensive test suite covering:
- UI component work
- Documentation updates
- Hook enhancements
- Test execution
- Issue fixing
- Generic requests

All tests now pass with natural, grammatically correct summaries.

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- Frequent "operation timed out" notifications from server delays
- False "Bryan error operation timed out" for normal operations
- Awkward summaries: "Bryan, I have finished completed the task"
- Generic, unhelpful completion messages

### After
- No timeout errors (async execution prevents server delays)
- Only real timeout errors trigger notifications (refined detection)
- Natural summaries: "Bryan, I have finished fixing issues"
- Context-aware messages based on actual work performed

## Configuration

No additional configuration required. The system automatically:
- Uses async event sending to prevent timeouts
- Generates contextual summaries based on session activity
- Preserves all existing functionality

## Future Enhancements

1. **Smart Retry Logic**: The `enhanced_http_client.py` provides retry capabilities if needed
2. **Customizable Summaries**: Could add user preferences for summary style
3. **Multi-language Support**: Could extend summaries for different languages
4. **Analytics**: Track most common summary types for insights

## Troubleshooting

### If Timeout Errors Return
1. Check if observability server is running: `curl http://localhost:4000/health`
2. Verify async wrapper is being used in `.claude/settings.json`
3. Check server logs for performance issues

### If Summaries Are Generic
1. Ensure session logs are being written to `~/.claude/sessions/`
2. Verify file modifications are being tracked in `pre_tool_use.json`
3. Check that last prompt is captured in `user_prompt_submit.json`
