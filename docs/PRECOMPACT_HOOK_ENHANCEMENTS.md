# PreCompact Hook Enhancements

## Overview

Enhanced the PreCompact hook to provide more intelligent conversation summarization with additional summary types and improved TTS personalization.

## Completed Enhancements

### Phase 1: Expanded Summary Types ✅

Added support for additional Codex summary types beyond technical and executive:

- **Action Items**: Automatically generated when TODOs/tasks detected (3+ keywords)
- **Lessons Learned**: Generated when insights/learnings detected (2+ keywords)
- **Decisions**: Available but not auto-enabled (for future use)
- **Knowledge**: Available but not auto-enabled (for future use)

**Implementation**: Simple keyword detection with configurable thresholds. KISS principle applied.

### Phase 2: Enhanced TTS & Personalization ✅

Improved TTS messaging with context-aware formatting:

- **Context-Aware Messages**: Different tones for different content types
  - Action items: "attention needed" tone
  - Goal completion: "session complete" tone
  - Lessons learned: "insights captured" tone
- **Smart Message Combining**: Intelligently combines multiple summary types
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful degradation for parsing failures

**Implementation**: Enhanced `create_tts_message()` and `send_to_tts()` functions with contextual formatting.

### Phase 3: Advanced Observability Integration (Partial) ✅

Enhanced event data sent to observability system:

- **Summary Type Tracking**: Boolean flags for each summary type generated
- **Action Item Counting**: Extracts count from action summaries
- **TTS Message Logging**: Stores actual TTS message for tracking
- **File Path References**: Includes all generated file paths
- **Project Context**: Includes project name

**Implementation**: Enhanced `notify_observability()` with richer event data structure.

## Usage

The enhanced hook (now integrated into `pre_compact.py`) will:

1. Always generate technical and executive summaries
2. Conditionally generate action items when tasks are detected
3. Conditionally generate lessons learned when insights are detected
4. Send context-aware TTS notifications
5. Log enhanced metrics to observability system

## Testing

Test the enhanced hook:

```bash
# Test with action items and lessons
echo "Goal was X. TODO: task 1. TODO: task 2. We learned that Y works better." | \
  uv run /home/bryan/multi-agent-observability-system/.claude/hooks/pre_compact.py
```

## Files Modified

- `/home/bryan/multi-agent-observability-system/.claude/hooks/pre_compact.py` - Enhanced with new features
- `/home/bryan/multi-agent-observability-system/.claude/settings.json` - No changes needed

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 4: Historical Analysis & Search
- Summary indexing system
- Cross-session trend analysis
- Similar session detection

### Phase 5: Advanced Features
- Configurable summary templates
- External tool integrations
- Adaptive summarization

## Benefits

1. **Richer Context Capture**: Multiple summary types capture different aspects
2. **Better Audio Feedback**: Context-aware TTS improves user awareness
3. **Enhanced Metrics**: More data for observability and analysis
4. **KISS Compliance**: Simple implementation that works reliably
