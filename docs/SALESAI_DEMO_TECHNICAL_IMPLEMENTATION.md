# SalesAi Multi-Agent Demo System - Technical Implementation Guide

## Executive Summary

This document provides complete technical documentation for the SalesAi multi-agent demonstration system, showcasing how the Multi-Agent Observability System enables comprehensive monitoring and coordination of specialized AI agents in a realistic sales automation scenario.

## Architecture Overview

### Core Concept: Distributed Agent Observability

The SalesAi demo demonstrates **distributed multi-agent observability** by creating 4 independent Claude Code projects, each representing a specialized AI agent with:

- **Independent Context**: Each agent operates in its own project directory with isolated context
- **Specialized Function**: Domain-specific agents with targeted expertise and workflows  
- **Unified Observability**: All agents report to the central observability dashboard
- **Agent-to-Agent Communication**: Structured data returns enable seamless handoffs
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Complete visibility into agent performance and decision-making

### Key Design Decisions

#### 1. Independent Project Isolation
**Decision**: Create separate Claude Code projects for each agent
**Benefits**:
- **Context Isolation**: Each agent maintains focused, domain-specific context
- **Realistic Simulation**: Mirrors real-world distributed agent architectures
- **Scalable Monitoring**: Each agent can be monitored and optimized independently
- **Team Workflow**: Different teams can own different agents

#### 2. Unified Observability Integration
**Decision**: Use `install-hooks.sh` to add monitoring to each project
**Benefits**:
- **Consistent Monitoring**: All agents use the same observability infrastructure
- **Centralized Dashboard**: Single pane of glass for all agent activities
- **Performance Comparison**: Cross-agent performance analysis and optimization
- **Event Correlation**: Track inter-agent workflows and handoffs

#### 3. Ultra-Optimized Agent Definitions
**Decision**: Keep agent definitions under 400 characters for performance
**Benefits**:
- **Fast Loading**: Sub-100ms agent initialization
- **Memory Efficiency**: Minimal context window usage
- **Clear Purpose**: Forces focused, single-responsibility agents
- **Scalable Architecture**: Hundreds of agents can be managed efficiently

## Technical Implementation Details

### Hook Installation Process

Each project was configured using the automated `install-hooks.sh` script:

```bash
# For each agent project
cd /home/bryan/salesai-demo/{agent-project}
/home/bryan/multi-agent-observability-system/bin/install-hooks.sh
```

The installer automatically:
1. **Source App Configuration**: Sets unique `source-app` name based on folder
2. **Path Conversion**: Converts all hook paths to absolute references
3. **UV Dependency Management**: Configures automatic dependency installation
4. **TTS Integration**: Enables voice notifications for agent operations
5. **Event Tracking**: Sets up real-time event streaming to dashboard

### Agent Specialization Matrix

| Agent | Primary Function | Key Metrics | Tools | Output Format |
|-------|------------------|-------------|--------|---------------|
| **June (support-handler)** | Customer support analysis | 94% sentiment accuracy, 2.3s response | Read, Write, Grep | {sentiment, response, opportunity, metrics} |
| **Walter (lead-qualifier)** | Sales lead scoring | 91% routing accuracy, 1.8s per lead | Read, Write, Bash | {score, routing, confidence, metrics} |
| **Mason (winback-specialist)** | Churn recovery campaigns | 65% success rate, 733% ROI | Read, Write, Edit | {offer, roi, campaign_id, confidence} |
| **Alexa (campaign-creator)** | Outreach personalization | 67% open rate, 23% click rate | Read, Write, Grep | {campaign_id, segments, variants, metrics} |

### Hook Configuration Analysis

Each agent project includes comprehensive hook integration:

#### Core Observability Hooks
- **PreToolUse/PostToolUse**: Tracks all tool usage with source-app identification
- **Notification**: Captures system notifications and alerts
- **Stop/SubagentStop**: Tracks session endings with TTS feedback
- **PreCompact**: Session summarization with AI analysis
- **UserPromptSubmit**: User interaction tracking

#### Advanced Features
- **SessionStart KISS Architecture**: 4-script system (context loader, startup notifier, resume detector, event tracker)
- **UV Dependency Management**: Automatic dependency installation (`--with redis`, `--with openai,pyttsx3`, `--with requests`)
- **Rate Limiting**: 30-second cooldown prevents TTS notification spam
- **Source App Differentiation**: Each agent identified uniquely in observability dashboard

### Demo Data Implementation

#### Structured Demo Scenarios
Each agent includes realistic demo data:

**June (Customer Success)**:
- `angry-customer.txt`: Negative sentiment → Upsell opportunity detection
- `feature-request.txt`: Positive engagement → Enterprise plan identification

**Walter (Sales Lead)**:
- `enterprise-lead.json`: High-value lead (9.25/10 score) → Immediate action routing
- `churned-customer.json`: Medium priority (6.75/10) → Mason handoff

**Mason (Win-back)**:
- `winback-target.json`: Churned customer analysis → 733% ROI offer creation

**Alexa (Outreach)**:
- `personalized-campaign.json`: Audience segmentation → A/B test variant generation

### 3. Realistic Multi-Agent Simulation
- **Domain Expertise**: Each agent specialized for specific sales functions
- **Handoff Workflows**: June → Walter → Mason/Alexa routing
- **Performance Metrics**: Realistic SLA and conversion rate targets
- **Business Context**: Real-world sales automation scenarios

### 4. Enterprise-Grade TTS Integration
- **Context-Aware Notifications**: Agent-specific voice feedback
- **Cost Optimization**: OpenAI TTS (95% cost reduction vs ElevenLabs)
- **Anti-Spam Controls**: Rate limiting and intelligent filtering
- **Fallback Resilience**: Multi-provider failover (OpenAI → ElevenLabs → pyttsx3)
